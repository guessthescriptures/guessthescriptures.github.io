        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            <i>Guess the Scriptures</i> is a game in the style of a trivia
            game with the goal of strengthening one's memory of the Scriptures
            that teach certain truths.
        </p>
        <h2>How to Play <i>Guess the Scriptures</i></h2>
        <p>
            To play <i>Guess the Scriptures</i>, select <b>New Game</b> from
            the main menu.
        </p>
        <p>
            The game consists of a number of randomly selected questions. (By
            default, it is only one question, but the available questions and
            the number of questions per game can be adjusted in
            <b>Settings</b>.) The game presents one question at a time. Each
            question must be answered before the game can present the next
            question. The questions are based from Appendix A
            <a href="https://www.jw.org/en/library/books/love-people-make-disciples/appendix-a/">
                <i>Truths We Love to Teach</i>
            </a> from the brochure
            <a href="https://www.jw.org/en/library/books/love-people-make-disciples/">
                <i>Love People&mdash;Make Disciples</i>
            </a> published by Jehovah's Witnesses.
        </p>
        <p>
            Below the presented question is a 4 x 2 grid (or 2 x 4 grid for
            smaller devices) of at most 8 boxes each with an unchecked
            checkbox and a scripture associated with it. Checking a checkbox
            is a selection of the associated scripture. Check the checkboxes
            that answer the presented question.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can select the text of the scripture to read the full text
            before or after the question is answered. The full texts of the
            scriptures are from the modern-language
            <a href="https://www.jw.org/en/library/bible/study-bible/books/">
                <i>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</i>
            </a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            After selecting the scriptures that answer the presented question,
            to submit the selected scriptures, select the button labeled
            <b>Submit Selected Scriptures</b>. A pop-up dialog box will
            display the results. To close the pop-up dialog box, select the
            close button in the upper right corner of the pop-up dialog box.
            The boxes that each contain the correct scripture are highlighted
            in green. A point is given to your score if you selected only and
            all the correct scriptures for the presented question.
        </p>
        <p>
            To proceed to the next question, select the button labeled
            <b>Next Question</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            To restart the game at any time, select the button labeled
            <b>Restart Game</b>.
        </p>

            labeled <b>Return to Main Menu</b>.

        </p>
        <h2>Review the Questions and Their Correct Scriptures</h2>
        <p>
            Before or after playing a game, you can review the questions that
            may be presented in the game along with their correct scriptures.

            a scripture.
        </p>
