        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            <i>Guess the Scriptures</i> is a game in the style of a trivia
            game with the goal of strengthening one's memory of the Scriptures
            that teach certain truths.
        </p>
        <h2>How to Play <i>Guess the Scriptures</i></h2>
        <p>
            To play <i>Guess the Scriptures</i>, select <b>New Game</b> from
            the main menu.
        </p>
        <p>
            The game consists of a number of randomly selected questions. (By
            default, it is only one question, but the available questions and
            the number of questions per game can be adjusted in
            <b>Settings</b>.) The game presents one question at a time. Each
            question must be answered before the game can present the next
            question. The questions are based from Appendix A
            <i>Truths We Love to Teach</i> from the brochure
            <i>Love People&mdash;Make Disciples</i> published by Jehovah's
            Witnesses.
        </p>
        <p>
            Below the presented question is a 4 x 2 grid (or 2 x 4 grid for
            smaller devices) of at most 8 boxes each with an unchecked
            checkbox and a scripture associated with it. Checking a checkbox
            is a selection of the associated scripture. Check the checkboxes
            that answer the presented question.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can select the text of the scripture to read the full text
            in a pop-up dialog box before or after the question is answered.
            The full texts of the scriptures are from the modern-language
            <i>New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures</i>. To close the
            pop-up dialog box, select the close button in the upper right
            corner of the pop-up dialog box.
        </p>
        <p>
            After selecting the scriptures that answer the presented question,
            to submit the selected scriptures, select the button labeled
            <b>Submit Selected Scriptures</b>. A pop-up dialog box will
            display the results. To close the pop-up dialog box, select the
            close button in the upper right corner of the pop-up dialog box.
            The boxes that each contain the correct scripture are highlighted
            in green. A point is given to your score if you selected only and
            all the correct scriptures for the presented question.
        </p>
        <p>
            To proceed to the next question, select the button labeled
            <b>Next Question</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            To restart the game at any time, select the button labeled
            <b>Restart Game</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            To quit the game and return to the main menu, select the link
            labeled <b>Return to Main Menu</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The goal of the game is to answer all the questions correctly.
        </p>
        <h2>Review the Questions and Their Correct Scriptures</h2>
        <p>
            Before or after playing a game, you can review the questions that
            may be presented in the game along with their correct scriptures.
        </p>
        <p>
            To review the questions and their correct scriptures, select
            <b>Review</b> from the main menu.
        </p>
        <p>
            One question is presented at a time.
        </p>
        <p>
            To select a question to be presented, use the selection box
            labeled <b>Question</b> and select the question you want to have
            presented.
        </p>
        <p>
            Below the presented question is a 4 x 2 grid (or 2 x 4 grid for
            smaller devices) of at most 4 boxes highlighted in green each with
            a scripture.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can select the text of the scripture to read the full text
            in a pop-up dialog box. To close the pop-up dialog box, select the
            close button in the upper right corner of the pop-up dialog box.
        </p>
        <p>
            To present the previous question and its correct scriptures,
            select the button labeled <b>Previous Question</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            To present the next question and its correct scriptures, select
            the button labeled <b>Next Question</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            To return to the main menu, select the link labeled
            <b>Return to Main Menu</b>.
        </p>
        <h2>Adjusting the Settings</h2>
        <p>
            You can adjust the settings for the game such as which questions
            can be available for the game and for review and how many
            questions per game.
        </p>
        <p>
            To adjust the settings for the game, select <b>Settings</b> from
            the main menu.

        <p>
            A column of boxes is presented each with a checkbox and a question
            associated with it. A checked checkbox indicates the associated
            question is available for the game and for review. An unchecked
            checkbox indicates otherwise. You can check which question to be
            available. However, at least one checkbox can remain checked.
